# genesis
Scripts that creates training and testing data for geo-parsing from Wikipedia 

# structure
Genesis includes a folder for each page on the English Wikipedia with enough text with places to make a map.  Each of these subfolders includes two files.  The first is a .txt file that includes the text of the page.  The second is a geojson file that is a map of the places mentioned in the article.
